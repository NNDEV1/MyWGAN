## About The Project

Wasserstein GAN, or WGAN, is a type of generative adversarial network that minimizes an approximation of the Earth-Mover's distance (EM) rather than the Jensen-Shannon divergence as in the original GAN formulation. My aim for this project was to recreate the results of WGAN-GP with the MNIST dataset.



Here are some resources I used to implement WGAN-GP:

* [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
* [WGAN-GP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028)
* [PyTorch Implementation](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp)
 

Results: 
* Input: *MNIST Dataset*
* Output: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36611240/135368025-2bf3d95d-2865-46fa-a3b1-b4cfc3ccdd19.gif)


### Built With

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
* [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org)
* [ImageIO](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* *Clone git repository*
* *Make sure correct packages are installed(below)*
* *Run main.py*
* *or optionally for easier overall usage run WGAN-GP.ipynb in Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook*

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* numpy
  ```pip install numpy```
* pytorch
  ```pip install torch```
* imageio
  ```pip install imageio```


See the [open issues](https://github.com/NNDEV1/MyWGAN/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
